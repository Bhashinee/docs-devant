# Schedule Your First Automation

## Overview

In this guide, you will:

- Create a simple automation that will print `"Hello World"` every Day.
- Use Ballerina Integrator to develop the automation.
- Push the automation to Devant from the Ballerina Integrator which will automatically build the automation.
- Schedule the automation to run every Day.

<!-- Todo add a YouTube video tutorial for this quick start -->

## Prerequisites

1. GitHub account: [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) if you don't have one already.
2. If you're signing in to the Devant for the first time, create an organization:
    1. Go to [https://console.devant.dev/](https://console.devant.dev/) and sign in using your Google, GitHub, or Microsoft account.
    2. Enter a unique organization name. For example, `Stark Industries`.
    3. Read and accept the privacy policy and terms of use and Click **Create**.
3. VSCode: [Install VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) if you don't have it installed already.

<!-- Todo finalize the names and structure -->
## Step 1: Attach a Git repository
1. Go to [https://console.devant.dev/](https://console.devant.dev/) and sign in. This opens the organization overview page and lists the projects.
2. Select the **Default** project.
3. On the project overview page, click **Attach a Git Repository**.
4. Click **Authorize with GitHub** to connect Devant to your GitHub account. If you haven't connected your GitHub repository to Devant, authorize the WSO2 cloud app stage with your GitHub account [WSO2 Cloud App](https://github.com/marketplace/choreo-apps).
5. Under the **Organization**  dropdown click **+ Add**. This will redirect you to **Install WSO2 Cloud App Stage** page.
6. Select your GitHub account and install [WSO2 Cloud App](https://github.com/marketplace/choreo-apps)

    !!! note
        The **WSO2 Cloud App** requires:
        - Read and write access to code and pull requests.
        - Read access to issues and metadata.

        You can [revoke access](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/reviewing-your-authorized-integrations#reviewing-your-authorized-github-apps) at any time. Write access is used to push changes directly to your repository.

7. Select your organization under the **Organization**  dropdown. If your organization is still not listed click the Refetch button.
8. Select a repository to save your automation. Additionally, you can select a **Branch** and a **Path** of the selected repository to save your automation.
9. **Name** and **Identifier** fields will be automatically populated. Additionally, you can edit them to your preference.
10. Select the **Technology** as `Ballerina`.
11. Choose the **Integration Type** as `Automation` and Click **Create**.

This will redirect you to the overview page of the automation. Now, let's design the automation.

## Step 3: Install the Ballerina Integrator extension
