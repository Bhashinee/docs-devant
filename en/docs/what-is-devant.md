# What is Devant?

Devant is a powerful IPaaS with first-class AI support. Incorporate AI agents into the integrations you build in low-code and pro-code, and move away from siloed systems to intelligent digital experiences with Devant by WSO2—the AI iPaaS that your AI Agents can call “home”.

## Key capabilities of Devant

### Efficient and effective development
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Devant includes a developer friendly VSCode-based editor with an integrated AI copilot, which aids developers at every stage, from code generation to refactoring.
- **Unified Low-Code and Pro-Code Development**: Allows seamless transitions between low-code and pro-code development, accommodating a diverse range of developer skills and preferences.
- **Comprehensive Protocol and AI Support**: Built-in capabilities to integrate with third-party AI services, vector databases, and support for protocols such as TCP, UDP, FILE, Websub, and Websubhub.
- **Git Repository Integration**: Effortlessly connect to Git-based platforms like GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab to develop components by linking an existing repository.

### Design for security, governance, and developer experience
- **Cell-Based Architecture**: Leverage [cell-based architecture](https://github.com/wso2/reference-architecture/blob/master/reference-architecture-cell-based.md), where projects become governable units from development to deployment, ensuring managed access via APIs, events, and data.
- **Composable architecture**: Organize enterprise systems into domains, exposing managed APIs, events, and data through projects. Each project consists of components representing units of deployment.
- **Developer-Centric Design**: Tools and workflows tailored specifically for integration developers, enhancing debugging, testing, and issue identification.

### Seamless deployment
- **CI/CD**: Eliminate manual builds and unreliable deployments with Devant's industry-standard CI/CD tooling, providing complete control and flexibility.
- **Multi-Cloud Kubernetes**: Easily deliver cloud-native applications across Azure, AWS, GCP, or your Kubernetes clusters.
- **Configuration Management**: Centralize configuration parameters, sensitive credentials, and secrets across deployment environments via an intuitive interface.

### Effortless management of APIs, integrations, microservices, and web applications
- **Enable Security**: Empower security teams to manage data flows, ensuring seamless control over sensitive information like access credentials.
- **Scale Up or Down**: Kubernetes handles scaling automatically, optimizing costs by scaling services based on demand.
- **Ensure Reliability**: DevOps and SRE teams can easily manage deployed components with built-in insights and observability.

### Reusable digital assets
- **Control Visibility and Sharing**: Publish your digital assets to a shared marketplace for consumption by internal or external stakeholders, managed by role-based access control.
- **Internal Marketplace**: Devant's secure internal marketplace fosters transparency and efficiency with granular access control for publishers and consumers.

### Comprehensive observability
- **Anomaly Detection**: Stay ahead of issues with prompt notifications, ensuring balanced scaling and immediate action during unexpected mishaps.
- **Troubleshoot and Debug**: Quickly pinpoint and address root causes using detailed logs and data aligned in the same timeline, down to the machine-level details.

### Robust governance
- **DORA Metrics**: Monitor your DevOps efficiency with Devant DORA metrics, experiencing rapid improvements in time from deployment to production safely and robustly.
- **Engineering Insights**: Gain visibility into engineering insights and advanced data analytics to make data-driven decisions, optimize processes, and improve efficiency.
- **API Analytics**: Understand API performance and adoption patterns to identify and resolve operational bottlenecks.

Devant is your all-in-one AI-capable platform for building, deploying, and managing integrations with ease, security, and efficiency.
