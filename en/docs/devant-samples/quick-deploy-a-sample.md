# Quick Deploy a Sample

Devant provides a **Quick Deploy** option for samples, allowing you to deploy a sample with a single click. This feature enables you to quickly explore and experiment with the sample.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using the samples, complete the following steps:

  1. Go to [https://console.devant.dev/](https://console.devant.dev/) and sign in using your preferred method.
  2. Enter a unique organization name. For example, `Stark Industries`.
  3. Read and accept the privacy policy and terms of use.
  4. Click **Create**. This creates the organization and takes you to its **Overview** page.
  5. On the organization home page, click **+ Create Project**.
  6. Enter a display name, unique name, and description for the project.
  7. Click **Create**. This creates the project and takes you to its **Overview** page.

## Try out quick deploy

To quickly deploy a sample, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Devant Console](https://console.devant.dev/).
2. On the Devant Console header, go to the **Project** list and select your project. This opens the project **Overview** page.
3. On the project **Overview** page, **Try a Sample** card contains a selection of samples.
4. Hover over a sample of your choice and click **Quick Deploy**. This creates the integration and deploys it automatically.

## Post-deployment actions

Once you deploy a sample, follow one of the post-deployment actions below based on the integration type:

- **For Integration as API**: Go to the **Console** under **Test** dropdown on the left navigation to test the deployed API.

This feature allows you to quickly explore and understand how Devant works with minimal setup.
